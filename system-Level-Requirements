> #### "A designer makes things... Typically his making process is complex. There are more variables, kinds of possible moves, norms and interrelationships of these than can be represented in a finite model.” – Donald A Schon.

Last  time, I discussed how to gather functional requirements for any large scale software development projects. This time, I would like to present system or non-functional requirements for a software. I compiled this list while working on a large development project and have been using it since. It is meant to be a checklist covering all aspects of system level requirements. Not all points listed below may be relevant to all development efforts therefore the idea is to pick out the relevant ones.

This list is also available in github, so feel free to add any new aspects I may have missed. The following list is presented in alphabetical order.

### Non-functional System Level Requirements.

1. <b>Availability</b> - Desired up-time during which the system and data are available for use. What are the availability requirements?

2. <b>Batch Processing and feeds</b> - Is there any requirement for batch processing or nightly data feeds from other systems?

3. <b>Communications Interfaces</b> - Any communication functions the system will use needs to be documented. (example – web browsers). [The system uses HTTP protocol to communicate with the servers. Users use HTTPS (secure site) to login to the system.]

4. <b>Configurability</b> - what aspects of the system can be configured? 
   * How will be configuration be managed?
   * Who can configure the system and when?

5. <b>Data Visibility</b> – What are the data visibility requirements ?

6. <b>Data Versioning and or temporal aspects</b> - 
   * Does the system need to answer time sensitive questions related to its state?
   * Does the data needs to be versioned? 

7. <b>Design and Implementation Constraints</b> – Issues that will restrict the options available to the development team, including the reason for the constraint (example – technology choice).

8. <b>Deployment Topology</b> – 
   * Where do we need to deploy the system to ? 
   * What are the deployment constraints, procedures and support ? 
   * What will be the proposed deployment topology ? 
   * Do we need a Content Delivery Network?

9. <b>Documentation</b> - Describe the purpose, desired contents, level of detail, and formatting (User Manuals, Installation Guides, Online Documentation and Help Systems and Labeling and Packaging

10. <b>Efficiency</b> - How well the system utilizes resources such as memory, disk space, etc.

11. <b>Entitlements</b> - what features of the system needs to be entitled?

12. <b>Failover and Recovery</b> – How will the system recover from hardware failure,  software failure, load and peak loads? 

13. <b>Flexibility</b> - How much effort is needed to add new capabilities to the product? 

14. <b>Hardware Interfaces</b> - The characteristics of each interface between the software system and the hardware components of the system. 

15. <b>Interoperability</b> - How easily the system can interact with other systems?

16. <b>Logical Database Requirements</b> - Requirements for any information that is to be placed into a database, including data models, field types, frequency of use, integrity constraints and accessing capabilities.

17. <b>Look and Feel</b> - General requirements that capture how the system will appear? [The User Interface will utilize web pages and adhere to the standards already in place among the web-based applications.]

18. <b>Maintainability</b> - How easy it is to fix a defect or change a requirement in the system after it is deployed? [The system will follow all IT Change Management procedures when maintenance is required.]

19. <b>Memory Constraints</b> - Any constraints on the system based on memory usage? For mobile applications, this aspect will be more relevant.

20. <b>Operations</b> - Any operations required by the user? (example – client/user or content management). 

21. <b>Performance</b> - Include requirements placed on the software performance or on performance of the human interaction with the software. Describe throughput requirements. 
   * What kind of load can the system handle ( how many concurrent users/request ? )
   * How does the system perform during peak loads? 
   * Does the system fail gracefully?
   * What is the breaking point? 

22. <b>Portability</b> - How easily the system can be migrated from one platform to another or one machine to another ?

23. <b>Reference Data</b> – What are the reference data requirements for the system ? Where do we get this data from ?

24. <b>Reliability</b> - Probability of the software executing without failure for a period of time

25. <b>Reusability</b> - How easily a component of the system can be used by another system?

26. <b>Robustness</b> - How well the system needs to function when there is invalid data, defects, or unexpected errors?

27. <b>Security</b> - Specify the factors that would protect the software from accidental or malicious access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure. [e.g. Any file uploads using protocols such as FTP shall be secured using 128 bit encryption.]

28. <b>Site Adaptation Requirements</b> – Requirements specific to where the product software failure, load and peak loads ? will be installed (example – globalization requirements). [e.g. All timestamps shown by the system shall be translated into the local time where the system is installed]

29. <b>Software Interfaces</b> - The use of other required software products and interfaces with the system. [The system must accept orders from other external/internal systems that has different formats, or uses different protocols etc.]

30. <b>Software Licensing and Approvals</b> – What third party software ( both open source and vendor products ) does the system use ? What kind of licenses does each one of these software require ? Note: Open source software licenses also needs to examined since there are major restrictions of use

31. <b>Support</b> - What kind of support will be needed once the system is rolled out ? If deployed globally, how do we organize support teams ?( L1, L2 and L3 )

32. <b>Testability</b> - Ease with which the system can be tested for defects. 

33. <b>Tools</b> - What support tools needs to be built ? [ Eg: a tool to add new users ] This is perhaps one of the most important aspects of software development. 
 * Software Development Lifecycle Management tools
 * Automated testing tools ( functional, performance, load, failure or break  testing
 * Metrics gathering tools
 * Application management tools



34. <b>Usability</b>
 * How easy is to use for the end users?  
 * What kind of adoption challenges will the user face?
